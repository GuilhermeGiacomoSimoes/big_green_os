BOOTLOADER 
====================

The bootload is basically divided into the following parts:

* `mbr.asm`  is the main file defining the master boot record ( 512 bytes boot sector )
* `disk.asm` constains code to read from disk using BIOS 
* `gdt.asm`  sets up the GDT
* `switch-to-32bit.asm` contains code to switch to 32 bit protected mode

=====================

this bootloader will have to perform the following tasks:
1 - Loading the kernel from disk into memory.
2 - Setting up the global descriptor table (GDT)
3 - Switching from 16bits real mode to 32 bits protected mode and passing control to the kernel.
