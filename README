BOOTLOADER 
====================

The bootload is basically divided into the following parts:

* `mbr.asm`  is the main file defining the master boot record ( 512 bytes boot sector )
* `disk.asm` constains code to read from disk using BIOS 
* `gdt.asm`  sets up the GDT
* `switch-to-32bit.asm` contains code to switch to 32 bit protected mode
